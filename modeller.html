					<h2>Paid work</h2>
					<p>X% of Phd students surveyed perform teaching alongside their studies. Whilst x% of students state
						that they work to gain experience,
						X% of students state that they work to make ends meet. How would increasing the amount of paid
						work students can do affect their finances? </p>
					</p>
					<div id="chart" class="chart"></div>
					<div class="slidecontainer">
						<input type="range" min="0" max="10" value="5" class="slider" id="hours" ,
							onchange="graphplotter()">
					</div>

					<div class="sliderlabel" id="demo"></div>

					<p>Working can provide some additional money, but this can come at a detriment to a student's
						studies.
						The number of hours on offer is limited: x% of students said they would work more hours if given
						the opportunity.
						However, even working 10 hours a weekend does not put a fully funded student above the ONS
						affordable housing threshold </p>

					<h2>Stipend Increase</h2>
					<p>A stipend increase would be one way to improve the financial situation of PGRS. But who would
						bear the increased cost?
						UKRI is the largest funder of PhDs in the UK, funding more than 22,000 students a year. How
						would changing the stipend affect their spending?
					</p>

					<h2>Support from the University</h2>
					<p>The University of Bristol has roughly 2200 postgraduate research students: this figure will
						include both masters and PhD students. In 2022, the University of Bristol's financial statements
						showed a profit of £55 million. Can the University afford to financially support its students?
						<br>
						The work of PhD students plays a vital role in the University's research output, which is
						instrumental in acquiring grants and funding, which makes up 22% of the University's income.
						Post graduate students also pay tuition fees, with an average of £5,600 per student. For funded
						students, these tuition fees are covered by the funder: this money has already been allocated
						for the student's education. If the University were to reduce tuition fees, and return this
						money to students, what affect would it have on the finances of the student and University?
