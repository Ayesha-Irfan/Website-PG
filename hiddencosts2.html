                                    than a home student, this is often due to the lack of a British guarantor. For the
                                    same reason, international students are often subject to much higher desposits for
                                    renting and are often asked to pay multiple installments of rent in advance.</p>
                                <p>After paying their rent, bills and food*, the average international student living in
                                    Bristol has just <b>£236</b> left for everything else in the month. This includes
                                    travel, resources for study and any unexpected payments that they may have to make.
                                    Many students rely on savings, while others take out loans to survive during the
                                    cost of living crisis.</p>

                    <h3>Outside of the monthly expenses, international studens are subject to many other costs:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Student Visa: £363</b> for your UK student visa which will allow you to live and study in
                            the UK throughout your course. Many students are informed of a successful application with
                            less than 3 months to organise their living plans and their visas, this means that the visa
                            has an additional <b>£500</b> charge to be priority and if it is very short notice, an
                            additonal fee of <b>£1290</b> must be paid for superior priority. Although all successful
                            international applicants submit their applications over 8 months before their study, they
                            often have to pay these <b>additional fees</b> due to the late decisions of the school they
                            applied to.</li>
                        <li><b>NHS Surcharge: £470 </b> for the Immigration Health Surcharge per year which will give
                            you access to the UK's National Health Service - this is the discounted student visa
                            holders, so over the course of the PhD this is <b>£1880</b>.</li>
                        <li><b>Fees for other healthcare: £2000+ on average </b> for dental care, opticians and other
                            services that are not covered by the Immigration Health Surcharge. Many students require
                            visits to dentists, opticians, physiotherapists over the course of their 4 year degree and
                            they have to pay for these out of the £236 they have remaining at the end of the month. If a
                            student needs surgery, the need to pay for this out of pocket; the average cost of a surgery
                            is £2500 in the UK and this results in many students taking out loans to cover the cost.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Visiting Home: £200+</b> for flights to visit home in between your PhD study. Being a
                            postgraduate researcher in a new country can be an isolating experience, but for many PhD
                            students visits home are very infrequent due to the low stipend they receive. Just visiting
                            loved ones twice a year can cost over £1000 for the course of the PhD.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Surcharge & Visa Increase 2024</h2>
                    <h3>The government has recently announced that they will be increasing the Immigration Health
                        Surcharge to <b>£1035 per person</b> and visa costs as well this following year:</h3>
                    <blockquote>On 13 July 2023, the UK Government announced that the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS)
                        will increase by 66%, from £624 to £1,035 per person per year for most main applicants. UK visa
                        application fees are also set to increase by at least 15%.

                        The Government has not yet announced when this substantial increase in the cost of applying for
                        a UK visa will come into effect. However, the timing of the announcement suggests that it may be
                        as soon as the Autumn. - Richmond Chambers.</blockquote>
